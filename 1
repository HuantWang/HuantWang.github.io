Recommended Local Restaurants

Shaanxi Cuisine

Chang’an Yinji (not “Chang’an Impression”)

Barbecue

Haotailang (highly recommended by my wife)

Cuisong BBQ (my wife doesn’t like it, but the garlic flatbread is great; some other local BBQ places may be too local for outsiders, but still interesting to try)

Xi’an Classics

Zhiliang Steamed Dumplings

Gan Mianpi (Cold Noodles)

Chopped Chili Roujiamo (available at Shuanmazhuang Mianpi shop; I personally prefer it over traditional meat-only Roujiamo)

Pangzi Zenggao (must buy before 7:30 AM or it sells out quickly; enjoy it with a bowl of Hulatang across the alley)

Beef or Mutton Paomo (classic shops like Lao Mijia, listed as “One Spoon Soup” on maps; Mahong Stir-Fry is a tasty variation)

Noodles (locals mostly eat noodles at home; but you can visit the internet-famous “Tianxia Diyimian”—the “long and wide noodles / big and round bowls” meme place—10 minutes from the hotel, though I haven’t tried it)

Street Food

Sajinqiao Snack Street — better than the touristy Muslim Quarter.

Important Reminders

The weather is extremely cold.
You MUST wear a hat, scarf, and your warmest down jacket.
This is an order!

Bring masks.
It’s flu season, and masks are recommended in crowded places.
